Welcome back to the blog post series on Mathematical Imaging. We're going to continue with image processing. We saw last time that we can apply some image transforms to help with visibility and contrast of the image. In this blog post we will be working in the spatial domain.

Before we begin let us define what the spatial domain of an image space is.

# Spatial Domain #

Definition: The 2D matrix representation $$M$$ of an image. The coordinates of element (i,j) in $$M$$ represents a single pixel and the value of the matrix represents the intensity of the given pixel.


So, we're basically just going to be working with the standard our image pixel by pixel. Our processing is going to depend on the intensity values of our image.

Let us begin by importing an image as we did last time.


```python
# import necessary packages
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skimage import io
plt.rc('axes', labelweight='bold', labelsize='large',
       titleweight='bold', titlesize=18, titlepad=10)

img = io.imread('hidden.jpg', as_gray = True)

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(img,cmap = 'gray')
plt.colorbar(fraction = 0.025)
plt.show()
```

As we can see we have a cat trying to hide in the dark. We need a clearer image of our suspect. Let's take a look how we can do that so that we can arrest the right cat.

# Histogram Equalization #

We are only going to cover the discrete version of the Histogram Equalization. Let's start setting things up.\
\
Let $$f(x,y) = $$ input image and $$g(x,y)$$ = output image.\
We know that $$f,g\in [0,L-1]$$.\
So, for $$r = f(x,y)$$ and $$s = g(x,y)$$ we have $$r,s \in [0,L-1]$$\
Let $$T:[0,L-1]\to [0,-1]$$ such that $$T(r) = s$$.\
\
Now for any gray level $$0\le r_k \le L-1$$ we take $$h(r_k) = n_k$$ where $$n_k$$ is the number of pixels from our original image $$f$$ that takes the value $$r_k$$.\
Thus, if we take $n$ to be the size of our image, then $$p(r_k) = \frac{n_k}{n}$$. So, $$p(r_k)$$ is the probability of the occurence of the gray level $$r_k$$ in the image $$f$$ and $$\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}p(r_k) = 1$$.\
\
Let's start by computing $$p(r_k)$$ for our image. First though we should


```python
# we'll start by rescaling our intensity values from [0,1] to [0,254]
f = img*254
f = f.astype(int)

# Extract the maximum intensity value found in in the input image f
L = np.amax(f)

# Get the shape of the image to run an appropriate for loop
M,N = f.shape
# Get total number of pixels in the input image
n = f.size

# initialize empty array with the appropriate size
Prk = np.zeros(L+1)

# Compute the probability of the occurence of each gray level
for i in range(L+1):
    Prk[i] = (f[f==i].size)/n
```


```python
spirit = f.reshape((1,n))[0]
```

Before we continue Let's take a look at our original images histogram.


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.hist(f.reshape((1,n))[0], bins = 255,density = True)
plt.xlim(xmin = 0)
plt.show()
```


    
![BP9_1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP9_1.png)
    


As you see most of our pixels are on the lower end of the intensity scale. So, our image, as we saw, is too dark and has low contrast. Hopefully, histogram equalization can help fix this problem. Let's keep going! The rest is pretty simple.\
\
So, we have $$r_k$$ and $$p(r_k)$$ and we want $$T(r_k) = s_k$$ so let's define $$T(r_k)$$.\
\
We take $$s_k = (L-1)\sum_{j=0}^k p(r_j)$$.\
Finally, $$T(r_k) = s_k$$\
Which means if $$f(x,y) = r_k$$ then $$g(x,y) = s_k$$.\
\
Let's now apply this to our image.



```python
s_k = np.zeros(L+1)
g = np.zeros((M,N),int)
for i in range(L+1):
    s_k[i] = (L-1)*(sum(Prk[0:i]))
    
for i in range(M):
    for j in range(N):
        g[i][j] = s_k[f[i][j]]
```


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(g,cmap = 'gray')
plt.colorbar(fraction = 0.025)
plt.show()
```


    
![BP9_2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP9_2.png)
    



```python
spirit = g.reshape((1,n))[0]

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.hist(g.reshape((1,n))[0], bins = 255,density = True)
plt.xlim(xmin = 0)
plt.show()
```


    
![BP9_3]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP9_3.png)
    


Well, clearly the histogram has shifted and is much flatter. There is a lot more contrast in the image and it is not as dark as it was before. So, we've accomplished our goal even though the image is still low quality and visibility is still low. Of course, this image is not a good example for histogram equalization. I simply chose it because I love my cats.\
\
Let's build a function that can apply histogram equalization to an input image and see if we can't find a better example for this.


```python
# We're gonna build a function that will 

def histeq(img):
    '''
    Function to apply histogram equalization to a black and white image
    
    Input:
            img: 2D array representing the input image
            
    Output:
            g: 2D array of input image after applying histogram equalization
    '''
    # Prep image so that its formating is easier to work with
    # we do lose some information
    f = img
    
    # We're going to check whether our intensity scales from [0-1]
    # if it does we will need to convert it to [0-255]
    if f[(f > 0)& (f<1)].size > 0:
        f= f*255
        
    f = f.astype(int)
    
    # extract the maximum luminosity of pixels in our image
    L = np.amax(f)
    # extract the number of rows and columns in f and save them
    # to M and N respectively
    M,N = f.shape
    
    # extract the total number of pixels in f
    n = f.size
    
    # initialize empty array that will be used to store
    # the occurence probability of each luminosity value in
    # f
    Prk = np.zeros(L+1)
    
    # Compute occurence probability
    for i in range(L+1):
        Prk[i] = (f[f == i].size)/n
    # initialize empty array to that will help calculate luminosity
    # of output image
    s_k = np.zeros(L+1)
    
    # initialize array of output image
    g = np.zeros((M,N),int)
    
    # compute s_k as described
    for i in range(L+1):
        s_k[i] = (L-1)*(sum(Prk[0:i]))
        
    
    # use s_k to apply image transform
    for i in range(M):
        for j in range(N):
            g[i][j] = s_k[f[i][j]]
            
    # return output image g    
    return g
    
```

Great now lets see the results using a new image.


```python
img2 = io.imread('ouch.jpg',as_gray = True)
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(img2,cmap = 'gray')
plt.colorbar(fraction = 0.025)
```




    <matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar at 0x232830cc988>




    
![BP9_4]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP9_4.png)
    



```python
eq_ouch = histeq(img2)

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(eq_ouch,cmap = 'gray')
plt.colorbar(fraction = 0.025)
```




    <matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar at 0x23283348c08>




    
![BP9_5]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP9_5.png)
    



```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.hist(img2.reshape((1,img2.size))[0], bins = 255,density = True)
plt.title(label= "Histogram of original image")
plt.xlim(xmin = 0)
plt.show()
```


    
![BP9_6]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP9_6.png)
    



```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.hist(eq_ouch.reshape((1,eq_ouch.size))[0], bins = 255,density = True)
plt.xlim(xmin = 0)
plt.title(label = 'Histogram of equalized image')
plt.show()
```


    
![BP9_7]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP9_7.png)
    


Well those histograms aren't very pretty. We can see though how the equalized image is clearer. Especially the main subject of the image. Not a bad use of histogram equalization.\
\
Let's do one last example.


```python
check = io.imread('check.jpg',as_gray = True)
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(check,cmap = 'gray')
plt.title(label = 'Original Image')
plt.show()
```


    
![BP9_8]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP9_8.png))
    



```python
checked = histeq(check)
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(checked,cmap = 'gray')
plt.title(label = 'Equalized Image')
plt.show()
```


    
![BP9_9]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP9_9.png))
    



```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.hist(check.reshape((1,check.size))[0]*255, bins = 256,density = True,range = (0,255))
plt.xlim(xmin=0)
plt.title(label = 'Histogram of original image')
plt.show()
```


    
![BP9_10]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP9_10.png))
    



```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.hist(checked.reshape((1,checked.size))[0], bins = 256,density = True,range = (0,255))
plt.title(label = "Histogram of equalized image")
plt.xlim(xmin = 0)
plt.show()
```


    
![BP9_11]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP9_11.png))
    


There. That's a dramatic difference. Look at that equalized histogram. Brings a tear to your eye to see them grow and mature.\
\
Anyway, no time for emotions here! We're learning. Go take a break. Maybe try implementing it on your own or learn more about it. I'll be back next time with more imaging tomfoolery.
