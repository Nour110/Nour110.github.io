Welcome back. Today we're actually going to dive into some mathematical imaging. We're gonna start at the basics. For now, we will restrict ourselves to grayscale images.

# Representation of Images #

We are going to focus only on the discrete formulation of images.

An image can be though of as a matrix, indeed we can even write 
$$ image \approx f_{i,j} = \begin{bmatrix}f_{0,0}&f_{0,1}&\cdots f_{0,n}\\
                                          f_{1,0}& \cdots &\\
                                          \vdots\\
                                          f_{m,0}\end{bmatrix}$$
with $$0\le i \le m$$ and $$0\le j\le n$$.

Each $$(i,j) = pixel$$ and the value of $$f(i,j)$$ is the intensity of the pixel with $$0\le f(i,j) \le 1$$ or $$0 \le f(i,j) \le 255$$.

If $$f(i,j) = 0$$ then $$f(i,j)$$ is a black pixel on our image. 

# Example of an image #


```python
# We're going to simply load in an image and display it in various forms.
# We begin with some key packages
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skimage import io
plt.rc('axes', labelweight='bold', labelsize='large',
       titleweight='bold', titlesize=18, titlepad=10)

# Now we'll simply import in an image that is located in our directory
# We're going to import it as a grayscale image to simplify things
img = io.imread('img0.jpg',as_gray = True)

# Let's check out some detail on this new object
print(type(img))
print(img.shape)
```

    <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
    (2160, 3840)
    

Unsurprisingly, we have ourselves a numpy array with shape 2160x3840. So, we have ourselves a matrix.


```python
img
```




    array([[0.53885255, 0.53493098, 0.52148471, ..., 0.57202627, 0.56418314,
            0.57538235],
           [0.50748   , 0.48787216, 0.47050431, ..., 0.54597412, 0.53420941,
            0.54065373],
           [0.46658275, 0.43913176, 0.43128863, ..., 0.54066863, 0.52666392,
            0.52666392],
           ...,
           [0.67523882, 0.66347412, 0.65536314, ..., 0.65888902, 0.67457529,
            0.67065373],
           [0.66880235, 0.64976   , 0.63967686, ..., 0.60733529, 0.61125686,
            0.60733529],
           [0.64527294, 0.62174353, 0.61614745, ..., 0.56419804, 0.5445902 ,
            0.54851176]])




```python
img.max(),img.min()
```




    (1.0, 0.0)



As we can see, each value of our matrix is between 0 and 1.


```python
# We can use pyplot to display the image

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(img,cmap = 'gray')
plt.colorbar(fraction = 0.025)
```




    <matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar at 0x235b6938ac8>

What we have here is a grayscale digital image of one of my cats. A numpy array of values between 0 and 1.

# Image processing #

Now that we know the very basics, we can move on to some basic image processing.

Think of image processing in terms of a function.
You input an image, process it and you output an image.

The output image and does not have to be the same size of the input image.

For example, subsampling gradually reduces the size and resolution of an image.

We can begin by just removing every other row and column from the image.


```python
subsample = img
even_rows = [i for i in range(subsample.shape[0]) if i%2==0]
even_columns = [i for i in range(subsample.shape[1]) if i%2==0]
subsample = np.delete(subsample,even_rows, 0)
subsample = np.delete(subsample,even_columns, 1)
```


```python
subsample.shape
```




    (1080, 1920)




```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(subsample,cmap = 'gray')
plt.colorbar(fraction = 0.025)
```




    <matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar at 0x235b6a3f848>




    
![BP8_1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP8_1.png)
    


Do it again for an even lower resolution


```python
subsample = subsample
even_rows = [i for i in range(subsample.shape[0]) if i%2==0]
even_columns = [i for i in range(subsample.shape[1]) if i%2==0]
subsample = np.delete(subsample,even_rows, 0)
subsample = np.delete(subsample,even_columns, 1)
```


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(subsample,cmap = 'gray')
plt.colorbar(fraction = 0.025)
```




    <matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar at 0x235b6b0fe88>




    
![BP8_2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP8_2.png)
    


LOWER!


```python
subsample = subsample
even_rows = [i for i in range(subsample.shape[0]) if i%2==0]
even_columns = [i for i in range(subsample.shape[1]) if i%2==0]
subsample = np.delete(subsample,even_rows, 0)
subsample = np.delete(subsample,even_columns, 1)

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(subsample,cmap = 'gray')
plt.colorbar(fraction = 0.025)
```




    <matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar at 0x23584f26dc8>




    
![BP8_3]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP8_3.png)
    


LOWER


```python
subsample = subsample
even_rows = [i for i in range(subsample.shape[0]) if i%2==0]
even_columns = [i for i in range(subsample.shape[1]) if i%2==0]
subsample = np.delete(subsample,even_rows, 0)
subsample = np.delete(subsample,even_columns, 1)

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(subsample,cmap = 'gray')
plt.colorbar(fraction = 0.025)
```

Perfect. The image is still recognizable of course. Just way lower resolution.
But there that was a very basic way to process an image.

Let's look at other techniques used in image processing. Namely, let's explore some intensity transforms.

Let $$f(i,j)$$ be the input image and $$g(i,j)$$ be our output image then $$g(i,j) = T(f(i,j))$$ where $$T$$ is some intensity transformation.

Let's try a quick example.


```python
logged = img
logged= np.log(logged+1)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1,figsize = (28,18))
ax[0].imshow(logged,cmap = 'gray')
ax[0].set(title = 'Transformed image',yticks = [],xticks = [])


ax[1].imshow(img,cmap = 'gray')
ax[1].set(title = 'Original image',yticks = [], xticks = [])
```




    [Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Original image'), [], []]




    
![BP8_5]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP8_5.png)
    


What do you notice? While you think about it let's try and make it more concrete.
As we know each pixel $$f_{i,j} \in [0,1]$$. The closer you are to 0, the closer the pixel is to black. So, pixels that are closer to 0 are darker and pixels that are closer to 1 are lighter.

Let's make a quick graph to see how our transform acts on each intensity level pixels.


```python
# We will defin
L = np.linspace(0,1,1000)
L
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize = (20,10))
ax.set(xlim = (0,1),ylim = (0,1))
ax.plot(L,L,label = 'original intensities')
ax.plot(L,np.log(L+1),label = 'log transformed intensities')

ax.legend(loc = 'best',fontsize = 20)
```

![BP8_6]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP8_6.png)
    


What does this tell us? Well we've effectively compressed the interval of lighter values. Remember as we said before, the closer $$f_{i,j}$$ is to 1, the lighter it is.

This could be useful if the picture was too dark. Let's take a look at an example that might benefit from this sort of effect.


```python
imgd = io.imread('imgdark.jpg',as_gray = True)

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(imgd,cmap = 'gray')
```




    <matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x235c1ac81c8>




    
![BP8_7]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP8_7.png)
    


Let's see what the log transform does for us here.


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(np.log(imgd+1),cmap = 'gray')
```




    <matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x235ce278c48>




    
![BP8_8]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BP8_8.png)
    


Helps a bit but not much. Of course there are other transforms. Maybe we can dig one up to really make a dramatic difference here.


```python
melvin = (imgd)**(1/3)

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 9))
plt.imshow(melvin,cmap = 'gray')
```

Nice, we've definitely made it easier to see.
We'll get into more interesting concepts in the next post! See you there.
