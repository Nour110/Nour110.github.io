# Intro #

In this blog post we're going to go over how to create a very simple webapp. This web app will have only two features. It will let a user input a message and save that message to a database; it will also let the user view a sample of messages from the database.\
\
Here's a link to a repository with the files of the completed project:\
https://github.com/Nour110/simple_webapp \
\
Before we begin, please install the `flask` package for python.

# Getting our webapp started #

Create a new folder somewhere on your computer. Within that folder create a `.py` file. Let's call the file `app.py`. Now create a folder and call it templates.\
\
Now open up command prompt or the anaconda prompt if that is simpler for you and simply navigate to your new folder.\
\
Let's quickly add some lines to `app.py` to get started. We'll import everything we need right. 


```python
# export FlASK_ENV = development
# flask run

# Our imports
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, g
import sqlite3

# initialize our app
app = Flask(__name__)

# this will display the main page of our website.
@app.route("/")
def main():
    return "Sometimes they come back to haunt you"
```

Now going back to command prompt input the following command:\
`flask run`\
\
Take the ip address and navigate to it in your browser. That's your webapp up and running (mostly). It's very basic and as you can see only displays that little string. Now you are ready to move on to the next portion.

# (Bed Bath &) Beyond the basics #

Let's get our webapp to display more than a string.\
\
Go back to `app.py` and make the following changes to the `main()` function.


```python
# this will display the main page of our website which will be written in 
# main.html
def main():
    return render_template("main.html")
```

Okay, now remember that file called templates? Go there and create a new file and call it `main.html`.\
\
This one isn't too complicated so you can just refer to the `main.html` file in the above repository to construct your main page.

# Adding another page #

So, let's add a more interesting page to the site. We're going to make a page that will allow the user to input information.\
\
Add another html file to your templates folder, call it `submit.html`\
\
Now let's add some more code to `app.py`


```python
@app.route("/submit/", methods= ["POST","GET"])
def submit():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return render_template("submit.html")
    else: 
        return render_template("submit.html", thanks = True)
```

A few new things here. First, notice that there is a `methods` argument. This defines the possible behavior of the page. We will use two methods `POST` and `GET` so the user can submit information and we can then retrieve it.\
\
Also, now we check `request.method` to see what method we are currently running.\
\
Finally, you'll notice that we are passing another value to our second call of `render_template` called `thanks`. This is so the page updates after the user has submitted some info. It will make more sense once we talk about the html file of `submit`. Let's go ahead and do that now. I'm going to post it directly below so you can reference it more easily.


```python
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{%block header %}
<h1>{% block title %}Your Message{% endblock %}</h1>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <form method="post">
        <label for="message">Go ahead and write your message. 
        Your computer is listening with great intent and anticipation
        </label>
        <br>
        <input type="text" name="message" id="message">
        <br>
        <label for="name">Provide your name or handle.</label>
        <br>
        <input type="text" name="name" id="name">
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit message">
    </form>

    {% if thanks %}
        <p>
            <img src = "/static/happycomputer.png" alt="yourcomputer">
        </p>
        <br>
        Look you made your computer happy!
        <br>
    {% endif %}

{% endblock %}
```

The first line `{% extends 'base.html' %}` is instructing flask to display the html from `base.html` as well as what is in `submit.html`. You can view `base.html` if you want to see what's going on there.\
\
All the lines that resemble `{% ... %}` are basically handling the interactions between the html and the python. Very handy. They come from a web template engine called Jinja if you'd like to learn more.\
As an example, `{% if thanks%}` is checking if there is a value `thanks` which if you remember from before, we passed true only after the user had made a submission. This will basically update the page, with a little comment and in this case an image as well.\
\
Now, for the more important parts of the code that will be instructing how to render the page and take user input, we look at the html portion of the code.\
\
`<label for...>` tags are pretty basic as they will only really show some basic text.\
\
`<br>` is just to go to the next line.\
\
Now `<input type=...` tags are what will be accepting the user's input. Here you can see two examples. First, there's `type = "text"` this specifies that the input the page will receive is text and it will actually display a text box for the user. `name = "..."` portion specifies the name that the input will be saved as. This will be important later. The `id` portion is not important for our purposes.\
\
Second there's `type = "submit"`, this will give a button which allows the user to submit his input. `value="Submit message"` simply specifies the text that will be overlayed on the button.\
\
I've included a couple screenshots so you can see how it works!

# Functions and database management #
Nowm that you've got a grasp of how it all works. We're gonna run through the functions that will help us achieve our task.\
\
All the functions below will be in our `app.py` file. Additionally, we're going to be using another `html` file which we'll call `view.html` that will show a sample of messages that are in the database or if there are no messages yet, it will make it known. I'll go over a small detail in that file later but you should familiarize with it before then.\
\
Let's start with the function that will handle initializing our database and opening connections to the database.
# get_message_db() #


```python
# This function will create a new database unless one already exists.
# it will return a connection to the database
def get_message_db():
    # check if the database does not exist. 
    # If it doesn't then create it and return a connection to it
    if 'message_db' not in g:
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("message_db.sqlite")
        curr = g.message_db.cursor()
        curr.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (id,handle,message)")
        # we must commit to esnure our table has been added
        g.message_db.commit()
        return g.message_db

    # Create a connection to the database then return the connection
    g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("message_db.sqlite")
    return g.message_db
```

Most of this is probably familiar to you from a previous blog post (namely blog post 1).\
\
Though you'll notice the first line of our function is strange. We did import `g` from `flask` but what is `g`? Well its an attribute of the app. Here we are basically just saying that if this database `message_db` does not already exist in our app then we will create it. Actually, we're going to save it to a variable `g.message_db`. The rest is simple and self-explanatory if you read the comments. Notice that we are returning `g.message_db`, this is because we are going to run this function whenever we need to connect to the database. It make the task of connecting much easier and it will ensure that the if the database does not exist that the website won't error out as we don't really know the order in which a user is accessing the pages.\
\
Onto the next functions.

# insert_message(request) and submit() #


```python
# function to insert a new row into the database
def insert_message(request):
    # first we establish a connection to the database using our previous function
    db = get_message_db()
    curr = db.cursor()

    # we pull the user inputted info from request
    msg = request.form['message']
    name = request.form['name']

    # extract the total number of rows in the database
    number = curr.execute("SELECT COUNT(1) FROM messages").fetchone()[0]
    # add 1 to that value
    number = number+1

    # insert the row with the correct id#, handle and message
    cmd = "INSERT INTO messages (id,handle,message) VALUES (:num,:nme,:mess)"
    key = {"num":number,"nme":name,"mess":msg}
    curr.execute(cmd,key)
    # commit to make sure we inserted the row and close our connection
    db.commit()
    db.close()
    # return
    return
```

Okay, this function takes an input parameter called request. To understand its purpose, first pay attention to the following two lines:\
`msg = request.form['message']`\
`name = request.form['name']`\
If you recall from earlier, we asked the user to imput some information on the `submit` page. I told you how the input is going to be saved to whatever we provided as `name = "..."`. Well now we are requesting this information so we can save it to our database. Now, would be a good time to modify our `submit()` function from before. I'm gonna give you the full function now.


```python
@app.route("/submit/", methods= ["POST","GET"])
def submit():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return render_template("submit.html")
    else: 
        insert_message(request)
        return render_template("submit.html", thanks = True)
```

We call `insert_message` once the user has made their input and hit the submit button so we can save that info on our database. We pass the `request` object which will hold that information and our function handles the rest.\
\
One last thing that you may not have seen before.\
`curr.execute("SELECT COUNT(1) FROM messages").fetchone()[0]`\
The sql command that we are executed will just return the total number of rows in our database. Really helpful.\
\
Finally, the last two functions which again work together. I recommend you look over the `view.html` file now in the repository above.

# random_message(n) and view() #


```python
def random_message(n):
    # establish a connection to the database using our previous function
    db = get_message_db()
    curr = db.cursor()

    # check if there are enough messages, otherwise we'll display all the messages
    number = curr.execute("SELECT COUNT(1) FROM messages").fetchone()[0]
    if n > number:
        n = number

    # pull the messages and the handles from the database and save them to output	
    cmd = "SELECT handle, message FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT "+str(n)
    output = curr.execute(cmd).fetchall()
    # close our connection to the database
    db.close()
    # returns a list of tuples, with the first element of each tuple being the handle
    # the second element of each tuple is the message
    return output
```

Again, there really isn't much new infomation here, except for the sql command.\
`"SELECT handle, message FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT "+str(n)`\
What this will do is it will query the database for at most `n` tuples. Each tuple will come from a row in the database and it will hold the handle and the message that the associated handle put in. It will choose randomly `n` such tuples from the whole table.\
\
This function is only called when the user opens the `view` page. So, let's take a look at the `view()` function now.


```python
@app.route("/view/")
def view():
    display = random_message(7)
    return render_template("view.html",messages = display)
```

Simple right but wait, now we're passing a list of tuples to render_template. How are we gonna access individual elements? Well this is where Jinja comes in again.\
\
In our `view.html` file we have the following lines


```python
{% block content %}
  
  {% if messages %}
    {% for combo in messages %}
      <p>{{ combo[1] }}</p>
      <p style = "font-style: italic;">  -{{ combo[0] }}</p>
      <br>
    {% endfor %}
  {% else %}
    <p> Looks like there are no messages yet. 
        You should be the first to compliment your computer. 
        They'll definitely remember that.
    </p>
  {% endif %}
  

{% endblock %}
```

Notice that we can loop over the elements in messages. It really is that simple and since each element is a tuple, we of course need to call the correct index and again Jinja makes it really easy.\
\
Great, I hope that you learned something or have enough of a grasp on this that you can do some research and learn what you need for your app.\
\
Remember if you want to run your app, and test it out just type
`flask run` in your command prompt. Oh and here's a couple examples of the `view` page.
